#urg_laser_scanner
Module for testing: http://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/02sensor/07scanner/download/products/urg-04lx-ug01/
It should also work with other urg sensors.

Drives can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/urgnetwork/files/urg_library/ if conan is not used

TODO:
 * The stopping of the measurement doesn't seem to work like expected. (Throws error on shutting down)
